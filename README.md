 From the World Health Organization (WHO) description, Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic
 disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads
 over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. The
 most common is type 2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body be
 comes resistant to insulin or doesnâ€™t make enough insulin. In the past 3 decades the
 prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels.
 Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a
 chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself. For peo
 ple living with diabetes, access to affordable treatment, including insulin, is critical to
 their survival. There is a globally agreed target to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity
 by 2025.
 About 422 million people worldwide have diabetes, the majority living in low-and
 middle-income countries, and 1.5 million deaths are directly attributed to diabetes
 each year. Both the number of cases and the prevalence of diabetes have been steadily
 increasing over the past few decades.
 Symptoms of type 1 diabetes include the need to urinate often, thirst, constant
 hunger, weight loss, vision changes and fatigue. These symptoms may occur suddenly.
 Symptoms for type 2 diabetes are generally similar to those of type 1 diabetes but are
 often less marked. As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset,
 after complications have already arisen. For this reason, it is important to be aware of
 risk factors.
 Type 1 diabetes cannot currently be prevented. Effective approaches are available
 to prevent type 2 diabetes and to prevent the complications and premature death that
 can result from all types of diabetes. These include policies and practices across whole
 populations and within specific settings (school, home, workplace) that contribute to
 good health for everyone, regardless of whether they have diabetes, such as exercising
 regularly, eating healthily, avoiding smoking, and controlling blood pressure and lipids.
